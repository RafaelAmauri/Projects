# Projects
All these projects were made by me, for learning a new concept or improving some skill I might have.
You can use the code in any way you may want to, with or without crediting me. The contents are 100% public.

## Image Studio

This is pet project of mine. In this repo I try to code some different and interesting image processing algorithms by hand. The main goal is to avoid using already existing image processing libraries and to do everything as close to pure python as possible.

The following techniques have been implemented:

* Dithering
* Quantization

## Tree

This is a project that aims to provide my own implementation of the tree command that can be found in operating systems. The main goal is to have a memory-efficient implementation and avoid using recursion by all means.

## Kernel Updater

This project asks you for a version of the Linux Kernel and automatically compiles and installs the kernel for you. It allows for some customization such as name of the kernel and compile flags.

## Qt Calculator

One of my first tries at developing a GUI-centered application. This is a simple calculator that uses Qt to help me learn how to write GUI software.
