# Projects
All these projects were made by me, for learning a new concept or improving some skill I might have.
You can use the code in any way you may want to, with or without crediting me. The contents are 100% public.

## Python Perceptron

This is a framework-less and library-less implementation of a SLP, or a Single-Layer Perceptron.
It was made for the task of classification and works very well given it only has a single layer.

## Tree

This is a project that aims to provide my own implementation of the tree command that can be found in operating systems. The main goal is to have a memory-efficient implementation and avoid using recursion by all means.

## Kernel Updater

This project asks you for a version of the Linux Kernel and automatically compiles and installs the kernel for you. It allows for some customization such as name of the kernel and compile flags.

## Qt Calculator

One of my first tries at developing a GUI-centered application. This is a simple calculator that uses Qt to help me learn how to write GUI software.
